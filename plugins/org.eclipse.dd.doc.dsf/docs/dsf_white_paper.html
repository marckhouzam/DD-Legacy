<h2>Debugger Services Framework (DSF)&nbsp; White Paper</h2>
Version 1.0<br>
Pawel Piech<br>
&copy; 2006, Wind River Systems.&nbsp; Release under EPL version 1.0.<br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
DSF is a service framework for implementing the model and communication
layers of Eclipse debuggers.&nbsp; The framework itself is actually
very small in terms of lines of code, because it mostly builds on top
of existing standard frameworks of OSGI services and Java 5.0
concurrency features.&nbsp; The value of DSF is the set of utilities,
patterns, and guidelines that together help solve some of the more
difficult problems we have with existing Eclipse debugger
implementations.<br>
<h3>Design goals</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">The
primary design goal is to overcome the problems with
existing Eclipse debuggers.&nbsp; These problems are:<o:p></o:p></span>

<h3>Features</h3>
The DSF features described below, more-or-less correspond one-to-one to
the problems in the Design Goals section.&nbsp; <br>
<h4>Concurrency Model</h4>
It may be a surprise that simply adopting a threading model would solve
performance problems with debugger communication, but indirectly, it
actually does.&nbsp; The primary reason for poor performance with
remote targets in debuggers such as CDT is the synchronous nature of
target communication.&nbsp; When a request is made at the UI level that
results in a command being sent to the target, then the client thread
is blocked while the command is being processed.&nbsp; After the result
if finally retrieved, the client makes the next request for data and is
blocked again.&nbsp; In this pattern the responsiveness of the UI is
slow, yet the majority of this performance hit is due to the latency of
the communication channel to the debugger back end.&nbsp; <br>
<p>There is one major improvement to this pattern implemented in the
platform already.&nbsp; The platform debugger views have been
re-written so that they spin off a separate thread for each separable
call to the debug model.&nbsp; The multiple threads each result in
individual requests being sent to the target, and each thread is
blocked waiting for the result.&nbsp; Overall the responsiveness of the
view is improved because all the request threads execute in
parallel.&nbsp; However, there is one obvious limitation of this
approach: creating a lot of new threads, even when using a thread pool,
is an expensive operation and can in itself degrade performance,
therefore this solution doesn't scale well to programs that for example
have thousands of threads, or threads, or variables.<br>
</p>
<p>There is also a more subtle limitation of using jobs.&nbsp; Most
debuggers have a very lopsided performance characteristic, where it
takes a long time to initiate a query for the target, but once a query
is run, it takes relatively little extra time to retrieve larger
amounts of data.&nbsp; Therefore, to better optimize the performance of
communicating with a remote target, it is important to coalesce
individual requests into queries for larger chunks of data.&nbsp; This
is a rather complicated problem, mostly because the commands available
in debugger back ends vary depending on the type of data being
retrieved.&nbsp; Also different types of data require different types
of coalescing.&nbsp; For example, where it might be possible to
retrieve memory in arbitrarily sized chunks, registers may be
retrievable only in groups.&nbsp; There is one thing all coalescing
solutions will have in common, though: they need to convert the calls
that are made to the service into objects, which can be compared,
sorted, and pooled together.&nbsp; Management of such objects requires
a lot of state information to be tracked by the service, and managing
the cache of the request results requires even more state
information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Managing a lot of state information, which coalescing optimization
requires, is exceedingly difficult in a free multi-threaded
environment.&nbsp; This is because the more state information there is
in the system, the more semaphores are needed to avoid race conditions.
The more semaphores are used, the greater the chance that deadlocks
will occur.&nbsp; There are many methods for managing concurrency in
systems with a lot of state information, and they all have some
drawbacks.&nbsp; One such example is the Eclipse resource system use of
<span style="font-family: monospace;">ISchedulingRule </span>and
jobs.&nbsp; Unfortunately this this concurrency model would not work
well for the debugger because the resource system has a clearly defined
hierarchy to its data: Workspace/Projects/File, so it&#8217;s easy to lock a
portion of the tree and still allow other clients to interact with
it.&nbsp; For debugger services, the relationship between state data is
not clearly defined and often very complicated, so if scheduling rules
were applied in a debugger implementation they would likely degrade
performance, because each request would probably need to lock the
entire system.<br>
</p>
<p>For its concurrency model, DSF imposes a strict threading
model.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">All services that make
up a debugger implementation must talk to each other using a single
dispatch thread, and no service can make a blocking call while in the
dispatch thread.</span>&nbsp; Conceptually this rule can be interpreted
as: all communication between services is accomplished by runnables in
a thread pool, where the thread pool size is just one.&nbsp; The effect
of this policy is that the dispatch thread acts as a single global
semaphore, and when executing on the dispatch thread, a client or a
service can perform arbitrarily complex operations, and can poll the
sate of as many services as necessary without worrying about the state
of the system changing concurrently.&nbsp; The single threading rule
only applies to the service interfaces, and does not preclude
multi-threading in the service implementations.&nbsp; In fact
multi-threading is utilized more in this architecture because many
blocking operations that would normally be performed on shared threads,
possibly slowing the UI responsiveness, now need to be performed using
background threads.<br>
</p>
<p>In summary, a restrictive threading model combined with asynchronous
interfaces, is the DSF solution to communication performance problems
because it allows debugger implementations to have highly complex logic
that handles coalescing and cancelling of requests, intelligent caching
of debugger requests, and other advanced features such as filtering and
configurable update policies.</p>
<h4>Services Model<br>
</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Fortunately
it's easier to see the connection between a
services model and addressing modularity problems.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Most current
debugger
implementations don't make an effort to separate out different
components that make
up the data model and communication layers.&nbsp; It is true that UI
components
usually interact with clearly defined data model interfaces, and in
case of CDT
the data model is somewhat separated from the communication layer using
the CDI
interface.&nbsp; However within the CDT data model and communication
layer
interfaces, there are enough references between the various objects to
make all
of them essentially inter-dependent.&nbsp; Furthermore, in the
implementation
of these layers, components use internal knowledge of other
components.&nbsp;
This is perfectly acceptable if we assume that the debugger
implementation is
going to be used as a single module, and any extensions can be built on
top of
it.&nbsp; But, it is important that vendors be able to selectively pick
and
choose components which they would like to reuse "as is" and which
components they would like to extend, modify, replace, or not use at
all.&nbsp;
In order to achieve that kind of modularity, a lot of design work has
to go
into interfaces not just between the major layers of implementation,
but also
between various components that make up these layers.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">To help build
a modular
architecture, DSF builds on the OSGI services framework, by providing
additional functionality of:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<ul>
  <li> organizing services into sessions,</li>
  <li>managing start-up and shut-down processes,</li>
  <li>managing events between services.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Additionally,
DSF includes an
initial draft of service interfaces designed to build a modular
debugger
implementation.&nbsp; These interfaces must be validated, and this can
only be
realistically accomplished by implementing several full-featured and
diverse
debuggers.&nbsp; We are seeking additional debug tool vendors from the
community to port to these interfaces in addition to Wind River.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<h4>Data Model</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The problems
of the data model are perhaps less severe than
problems of performance and modularity, but this is an area with a lot
of room
for innovation.&nbsp; We are used to thinking of the debug data model
in a
rather rigid terms, where there is a defined hierarchy of debug
targets,
threads, stack frames, variables, sub-expressions, etc.&nbsp; We are
also used
to seeing standard debug views of threads, stack frames, locals, and
watch.&nbsp; These expectations seem to be pretty accurately reflected
in the
platform debug model, on top of which all of the current Eclipse
debuggers are
based.&nbsp; This is a problem for two reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The direct
references between different types of objects prevent the debug model
implementation from being modular.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Extensions to
the debug model are limited to additions in functionality of the basic
platform objects and some additional object types.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Fortunately
in release 3.2, the Eclipse platform introduced
a way to circumvent the standard platform model and to drive the
content of
most of the standard debugger views using a completely custom data
model and a
set of viewer adapters.&nbsp; DSF aims to take advantage of this new
capability
to address the above problems, as well as to provide the additional
benefits
of:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Improving
performance by using the DSF dispatch thread model and asynchronous
methods.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Giving the
user ability to fully customize at runtime the content and layout of
debugger views.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal"
 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Points 1, 2,
and 3 are a side effect of DSF's Threading
Model and Services Model used in conjunction with the platform's
flexible
hierarchy interfaces.&nbsp; Point 4 is an innovative and exciting
feature that
naturally builds on top of the service model and flexible hierarchy.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first release of DSF to open source,
we have not yet implemented the capability described in point 4.&nbsp;
The
design for this feature calls for data driven, configurable views,
where the
configuration data drives the content and label providers to retrieve
appropriate information from the data model.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the service side, there needs to be a published data model
schema and
a query language interpreter, which will retrieve the data for clients.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We expect community discussion and design
work to help solve this problem, and we intend to present
implementations from
our commercial product as one possible solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">One final
point is that although the
DSF data model is fundamentally different than the platform debug model
and the
CDT extensions, a DSF debugger could easily be adapted to provide any
of these
API&#8217;s.&nbsp; This may require considerable effort, especially for
extensive
API&#8217;s like CDI, but is desirable and necessary to support the existing
CDT
community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
