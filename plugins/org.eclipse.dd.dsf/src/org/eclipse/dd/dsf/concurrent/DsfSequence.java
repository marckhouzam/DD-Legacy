/**
 * Convenience class for implementing a series of commands that need to be 
 * executed asynchronously.  
 * <p>
 * Certain complex tasks require multiple commands to be executed in a chain, 
 * because for example result of one command is used as input into another 
 * command.  The typical DSF pattern of solving this problem is the following:
 * <li> 
 * <br> 1. original caller passes a Done callback to a method and invokes it
 * <br> 2. the method is executed by a subsystem
 * <br> 3. when the method is finished it calls another method and passes 
 * the original callback to it
 * <br> 4. steps 2-3 are repeated number of times
 * <br> 5. when the last method in a chain is executed, it submits the original
 * Done callback
 * </li>
 * <p>
 * This pattern is very useful in itself, but it proves very difficult to follow
 * because the methods can be scattered accross many classes and systems.  Also
 * if progress reporting, cancellability, and roll-back ability is required, it
 * has to be re-implemented every time.  The Sequence class tries to address
 * this problem by containing this pattern in a single class.
