/**
 * The base class for data model objects.  
 * <p>
 * DSF services need to return objects to clients which can be used as 
 * handles to track data stored in the service.  Clients such as lazy-loading 
 * tree and table views retrieve a list of handles, then as needed, they 
 * retrieve the children and label information for these handles.  Because of 
 * this pattern, services need to be able to return a set of handle objects,
 * then as needed clients can retrieve data corresponding to these handles.
 * The DMC object is the interface that DSF services should use
 * to represent the handle objects that are to be referenced by view model.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: DMC objects are meant to be immutable and thus accessible from 
 * any thread instead of just the services dispatch thread. This is because 
 * clients may need to call context objects' methods on non-dispatch thread, 
 * especially equals and hashCode.</i>    
 * <p>
 * <i>Note #2: DMCs should also avoid holding references to service 
 * instances or other large chunks of data, because some of the clients may 
 * hold onto these objects for longer time than the life of the service.  
 * This may prevent the service from being garbage collected, possibly keeping 
 * a lot of resources tied up.  
 * 
 * @param <V> For each context object there is a corresponding data object 
 * which will contain information about that context.  This template argument 
 * allows the clients to avoid casting the data class when retrieving data 
 * for a context object.
 * 
 * @see IDataModelData
