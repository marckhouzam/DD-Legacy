Example demostrationg use of Debugger Services Framework (DSF) data
model interfaces.<br>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The example consists of two services, one that monitors a set of timers
(TimerService), and another that tracks a set of alarms
(AlarmService).&nbsp; The timers are incremented at a rate of one per
second, although for visual interest, timers are not synchronous as
each timer is incremented at a slightly different moment.&nbsp; There
is also a "Timers" view that displays the timers and alarms, and has
actions for adding and removing new timers and alarms.&nbsp; Most
interestingly, the view has a toggle action, which switches the layout
of the view from having timers at the root level, with alarms listed
below each timer, to having alarms at the root level with timers listed
below each alarm.<br>
